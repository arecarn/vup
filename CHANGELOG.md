# Change Log

The format of this change log is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)

All documented changes are from the perspective of an end-user and should not
contain internal implementation details of this project. Each Release provides a
summarized list of the changes since the last release, organized by order of
importance.

  repository.
